Types of machine learning systems
=================================

whether or not they trained with human supervision
 - supervised learning
 - unsupervised learning
 - semisupervised learning
 - reinforcement learning

## Supervised learning

here we also feed desired solutions, called labels

examples :

spam filter - basically spam filter is trained with many example emails along with their class(spam or ham) so here it learns to classify emails into spam and ham -- this is classification

predicting price of car given set of features of it like milage, age, brand, etc -- this sort of task is called regression

```
this is directly copied from book.

NOTE:
In ml an attribute is a data type (e.g., “Mileage”), while a feature has several meanings depending on the context, but generally means an attribute plus its value (e.g., “Mileage = 15,000”). Many people use the words attribute and feature interchangeably, though.
```

we can use regression algo for classification and viceversa
eg: logistic regression is commonly used for classification

## Unsupervised learning

the training data is unlabeled

eg: blog posts can be clustered based on their content like some age group of ppl read some type of blogs, some other age group read some other type of blogs, some gender read some type of blogs and how many ppl read some type of blogs, etc

dimensionality reduction is another example of unsupervised learning in which goal is to simplify data without losing much information, so we merge related features into one

eg: car's mileage can be merged into its age as it might depend on it,
anamoly detection algo is also an example of unsupervised learning,
association rule learning

```
TIP
It is often a good idea to try to reduce the dimension of your training data using a dimensionality reduction algorithm before you feed it to another Machine Learning algorithm (such as a supervised learning algorithm). It will run much faster, the data will take up less disk and memory space, and in some cases it may also perform better.

```

## Semisupervised learning

plenty of unlabeled instances and few labeled instances

partially labeled

## Reinforcement learning

learns by itself as it interacts with its environment and we give it feedback in form of rewards and punishments

eg: robots learning to walk

## Batch and online learning

batch learning - system cant learn incrementally, it must be trained using all data -- takes so much time so done offline - offline learning


if u want a batch learning system to learn new data u need to train a new version frm scratch on full data set including old data and new data

time consuming,lot of computing resources as u train on full data  - might take hrs so done only once in day or week (even this could be costly)

so if i want to do for stock prices, smart phone apps - this is bad...

so for them we have online learning

here u train it incrementally by feeding data instances on fly

also after it learns about data instance u can discard it(unless u want to roll back and replay the data) so this saves lot of space too...

online learning can also be used on huge real huge data sets where they cant fit in one machine's main memory (also called out of core learning) this loads part of data , runs training step then loads next part..


```
WARNING
Out-of-core learning is usually done offline (i.e., not on the live system), so online learning can be a confusing name. Think of it as incremental learning.
```

cons:
if bad data is fed to it, it will learn that too and will give bad results and if this is live,, clients will see it and go weee


## Instance based versus model based learning

Instance based - learn by heart and generalises new cases by using similarity measure by comparing them to learned cases

model based - build a model of examples and use it to make predictions

```
WARNING
Confusingly, the word “model” can refer to a type of model (e.g., linear regression), to a fully specified model architecture (e.g., linear regression with one input and one output), or to the final trained model ready to be used for predictions (e.g., linear regression with one input and one output, using θ0 = 3.75 and θ1 = 6.78 × 10–5). Model selection consists in choosing the type of model and fully specifying its architecture. Training a model means running an algorithm to find the model parameters that will make it best fit the training data, and hopefully make good predictions on new data.
```

## Main challenges of machine learning

what can go wrng? all we dng is selecting a model and train it on data
ok what if we have `bad data` and maybe `bad model`

- insufficient quantity of training data
- poor quality of data
- irrelevant features
- overfitting the training data
- underfitting the training data
