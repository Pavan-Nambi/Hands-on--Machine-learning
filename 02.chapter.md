# End to End machine learning project

main steps
- look at big picture
- get data
- discover and visualize data to gain insights
- prepare data for ML algorithms
- select model and train it
- fine tune model
- present solution
- launch, monitor and maintain system

data set - california housing prices from census data

### look at big picture

use this data to build a model of housing prices


follwing Machine learning project checklist

frame the problem

what is the objective? how does the company expect to use and benefit from this model?

are there any existing solutions? how they solve it? can we use them as reference?
