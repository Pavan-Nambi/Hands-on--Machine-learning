# End to End machine learning project

main steps
- look at big picture
- get data
- discover and visualize data to gain insights
- prepare data for ML algorithms
- select model and train it
- fine tune model
- present solution
- launch, monitor and maintain system

data set - california housing prices from census data

### look at big picture

use this data to build a model of housing prices


follwing Machine learning project checklist

frame the problem



<details>
  <summary>frame the problem</summary>

what is the objective? how does the company expect to use and benefit from this model?

are there any existing solutions? how they solve it? can we use them as reference?
</details>

data pipeline : a seq of data processing components
gets data from one end and outputs smthng else at the other end


okay so is this a supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning task?
is it a classification task, regression task or something else?
batch learning or online learning?


<details>
  <summary>select a performance measure</summary>

root mean square error (RMSE) is a typical performance measure for regression problems
