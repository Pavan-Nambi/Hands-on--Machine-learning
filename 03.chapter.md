## Classification

MNIST dataset - set of 70k small images of digits handwritten by students

each image is labeled with digit it represents

this set has been studied so much that it is called hello world of ML , ppl who make new classification algorithms try it out first on this dataset


sklearn.datasets pkg contains mostly 3 types of funcitions
 - fetch_* eg: fetch_openml() -- download real life datasetrs
 - load_* -- functions to load small toy datasets
 - make_* -- functions to generate fake data sets for testing or prototyping

generated datasets are nrmly returned as (input-data, target) tuple, both as numpy arrays

other datasetrs are returned as `sklearn.utils.Bunch` which is similar to dict, has keys and values

they generally contains

 - DESCR key describing dataset
 - data key usually a 2d numpy array
 - target key containing labels usually 1d numpy array
